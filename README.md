# Pong
An html5 version of the classic game, Pong

# Setup

## Without a server
If you don't want to host a server, feel free to open [/src/index.html](index.html) in the browser
and play locally.

## With a server
Requirements:
 - Node.js >= 14.0.0 installed
Run the server by typing `node server` (or `node server.js`) into the console. This will _not_ open
a browser tab automatically for you to play in. Instead, go to the IP address printed in the console.


# Controls

## Local games
 - Space or P - pause / resume
 - W and S - move player 1
 - ↑ and ↓ - move player 2

## Hosted games
 - Space or P - pause / resume (works a little differently)
 - W and S *or* ↑ and ↓ - Move your player
